                As can be seen, Syria has an enormous amount of refugees at the moment. When going back to 1990, the map shows that an even higher amount of refugees fled from Afghanistan. More than 6.3 million refugees from Afghanistan, a precentage of 52.5% of the inhabitants, against almost 4.9 million refugees from Syria, a percentage of 26.3% of the inhabitants. When looking at the country of asylum, the map shows that Jordan is the country that, in terms of percentage of its inhabitants, gives shelter to most refugees in all years. Regarding absolute values, besides Jordan, Turkey cares for most refugees nowadays, while back in 1990 Iran was the country that accomodates by far most refugees.

Most refugees nowadays flee from Syria, South Sudan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic, in descending order. Take a look at the data of these conflict areas and read more about it below.<br>
                        At the menu, one of the five different conflict areas can be chosen. The barchart shows the countries to which refugees flee. In the two-sided barchart, the gender and age is visualised. When clicking on a country in the barchart, the two-sided barchart will show the data of the corresponding country. Besides that, the age groups displayed can be changed by either clicking on the two-sided barchart or by means of the dropdown menu.</p>

                        <p class="w3-center">As can be seen in the barchart, most refugees from Syria flee to Turkey: almost 60%. The majority of these people is male and adult. These statistics about gender and age account for Somalia as well, but is the exact opposite for the other conflict areas. In particular from South Sudan, almost 63.5% of the refugees is youth, against 60.5% from Central African Republic and 52% from Democratic Republic of the Congo. From these three countries, the majority of the refugees are female.<br>
                        Remarkable is that, from Syria, most male and adults go to Turkey and Egypt, while most youth and female flee to Jordan and Lebanon. Male and adult refugees from Somalia mainly go to Uganda, while most youth and female seek shelter in Kenya and Ethiopia. When only looking at the data of youth, it can be seen that from all conflict areas, the group of children between 5 and 11 years old is the biggest. Lastly, the group of people of 60+ is very small overall.</p>

                        A group of rebels is active in Central African Republic, called Seleka. <em><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20798007" target="blank" style="color: #777;">"Seleka is a reference to fighters from three groups - Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR), the Union of Republican Forces (UFR) and the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP) - coming together to launch the rebellion. In 2007, these groups signed an accord with the government and agreed to be integrated into the army. But in late 2012, some of those rebels who joined the army deserted and took up arms once more. The rebels, who are mostly northerners, accuse President Francoise Bozize of not honouring the ceasefire deal, which promised the release of political prisoners and payment for fighters who disarmed."</a></em> - BBC
